    <h1>Oprah's Strategies</h1>
    <p> The mechanics behind the success of Oprah Winfrey depend heavily in the strategies she has used to become the capitalistic powerhouse of a woman that she is. In terms of the success of her talk show, Sarah Henstra, author of The Politics of Talk: The “Oprah” Interview as Narrative, describes a typical interview on Oprah’s show as “[mobilizing] the rhetorical conventions of testimony, witnessing, debate, dispute, confession, and psychotherapy” (Henstra 60). Oprah grew up in poverty and bounced around from living with her mother, father, and reportedly abusive grandmother. Now, with a net worth of 2.7 billion U.S. dollars, she is regarded as a classic “rag to riches” example. She perfectly embodies the American Dream. With a harsh and unnurturing yet educational upbringing, Oprah is able to harness her widespread view on topics that compare and contrast to the views of those interviewed on her show. On her show, interviews, and speeches she has given,  Oprah commonly credits herself for her success, and by doing so encourages others to follow her way of thinking. Henstra regards Oprah as “a comforting, nonthreatening bridge between the Black and white cultures” which “helps explain Oprah’s popularity among white as well as Black women” (Henstra 62).</p>
    
    <p>In Christopher J. Lee’s journal article The Story of O, he offers more insight to the tactics that make Oprah’s show so captivating to her loyal viewers. He stated “the Oprah phenomenon: her agile responsiveness to the events and trends of the day, her respect and attentiveness to the anxieties and intelligence of her (predominantly female) audience, and, above all, her skill at turning a divisive social issue—of cultural, political, or racial difference—into a moment of conciliation and community” (Lee 3). Unlike a good handful of daytime talk show hosts, Oprah focuses on current issues that people face emotionally and physically, compared to other hosts who tend to focus on celebrity gossip, scandals, and general nonsense. Because Oprah can fit into so many points of views (abused child, African American woman, lived in poverty, feminist, etc.) she has the ability to relate to her audience, make them feel at home, and make them feel as if they are friends. Henstra states that “Oprah’s periodic switch into southern Black vernacular is another manifestation of her ability to become one of the crowd” (Henstra 63). One of Oprah Winfrey’s biggest tactics is that she likes to tell personal stories about herself. By doing so, people in the audience feel as if they can relate to her, which in turn causes them to feel attached to her. </p>

    <p>Above is an example of how Oprah tells personal details of her upbringing to share with her viewers. You can see the tears in her eyes, the emotion that she is feeling seeps through the screen into your own life, and viewers see Oprah as a real person. By adding an appeal to ethos, she starts with a tear jerking story and ends with a message of hope to her viewers.

    <p> Although Oprah Winfrey gives the allusion of a trustworthy character that committed viewers feel like they know personally, Sarah Henstra criticizes Winfrey due to the fact that her name is her brand which she argues in regards to Oprah’s message as “centered on the idea of living one’s ‘authentic life,’ is a product for sale not only through her talk show but in her magazine, and most recently, on an interactive, multimedia website that boasts forty-five million page views per month” (Henstra 62). Because Oprah holds the amount of fame and fortune that she does, there is a grey area in analyzing what her true thoughts and actions are versus the meticulously planned actions thought up in a boardroom with her PR team and managers. A large part of her infamy comes from her ability to sell products and boost careers, with her own agenda in mind as well as the agenda her team has come up with, celebrities are hard to see through when analyzing their moral compass. In regards to how Oprah handles interviews with guests who have gone through some sort of violence, rather it be domestic abuse or rape, Henstra points out that “this discursive fascination with pain rather than on its relief is the source of many accusations against [The Oprah Winfrey Show] (and other talk shows) of trashiness - of selling spectacle and scandal despire all the self-improvement rhetoric” (Henstra 69).</p>
