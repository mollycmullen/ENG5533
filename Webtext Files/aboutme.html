    <h1>About The Author</h1>
    
    <img id="oprah" src="me.jpg">


    <p>My name is Molly Mullen and as the author of this project I am aiming to not only educate readers on how Oprah came to be, but how important it is for young women to have a powerful woman to look up to. I am in my junior year at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and am twenty-three years of age. I have been obsessed with Oprah from a young age. I remember at about age eight, the school library had a kids book about Oprah and I became intrigued with her roots because I never knew that such a wealthy woman started off in poverty. I wanted to focus my project on a woman and Oprah was the perfect fit. When I was younger (in my teenage years) I was completely obsessed with social media and based a lot of my personality off of who I was looking up to at the time. I think that by pointing out to my readers that it is important to research and to be aware of the kind of celebrity that you look up to, it will help them to make better judgements on the quality of the celebrities they choose to obsess over. In a world where people are pressured to conform to modern beauty standards and general beliefs, I think that it is important that I put my two cents in on why it is important to be cautious of who you base your beliefs from.
