    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    


    <p> After extensively researching the roots of Oprah Winfrey’s success and the tenets of Black feminism, I can conclude that she embodies an excellent example of what a woman should be. She is gracious, hospitable, and betters the lives of the people who follow her in her footsteps. She brought education to women in South Africa who otherwise would not have been educated. These women are encouraged to “pass it along,” thus making the world a better, more educated and equal place. She has a stealthy net worth, but she has put a lot of money to good use in charities to help the less fortunate and those seeking education who lack the high tuition rates charged by universities.  </p>

    <p> Instead of succumbing to her troublesome and rocky upbringing, she overcame her hardships and is using her life to make the world a better place. When Oprah is gone someday, the world will never forget her. The efforts she has made to brighten the lives of the people who look up to her will never be forgotten and her humanitarianism will continue to lead the dark world we live in into a brighter place.
