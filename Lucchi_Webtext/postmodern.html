        <h1>Postmodern Curriculum Development</h1>
    
        <p> The texts educators select for their classroom either perpetuate a single story or create opportunity for counter stories to be expressed (see: <a href="singlestories.html">Single Stories vs. Counter Stories</a>). In this section, I will explore curriculum development as a means for promoting student learning and curbing inequalities in education. Using diverse literature in the classroom, using a range of instructional materials as key texts, and providing opportunity for discussion of conflicting viewpoints within key texts are pedagogical strategies that promote such learning—certainly, such practices are positive examples of how inclusive curriculum development choices can draw in more students into the learning process, as they see themselves (and their own perspectives/experiences) reflected in course materials. However, this section will primarily apply narrative concepts to curriculum development—acknowledging that stories are one of the ways humans understand themselves and others, and that narrative is one of the fundamental ways through which we make sense of our experiences (see: <a href="narrativetheory.html">Narrative Theory</a>).</p>
            <p>  Crafting an effective curriculum is often the responsibility of higher education faculty—or, other times, it is handed down to instructors. While faculty members’ expertise and thought should certainly be used to craft a strategic curricula, the concept of single stories applies here—as what may be an effective curriculum plan for one learner may not be effective for another (see: <a href="singlestories.html">Single Stories vs. Counter Stories</a>). All learners bring a diverse range of experiences, ideas, motivations, and perspectives to the classroom—thus, it is impossible to fully predict the curriculum that will best facilitate authentic learning for every student. In <i>Curriculum development in the postmodern era: Teaching and learning in an age of accountability</i>, Slattery describes what he terms a postmodern mode of curriculum development—one that that is not static and structured, but rather “inclusive, interdisciplinary (perhaps, even non-disciplinary), and interspersed” (2013, p. 282). This kind of curriculum development, Slattery says, creates “an image of time and space that is very different from the irreversible linear arrow and progressive sequence of modernity”—thus, a postmodern mode of curriculum development emphasizes the “process of becoming”—both in terms of student growth and in terms of curriculum planning (p. 283). Curriculum development in the postmodern era is described as “a kaleiodoscopic and eclectic phenomenon that is the result of a vast, interrelated web of ideas, texts, personalities, architectural structures, literary narratives, and much more”—in other words, this mode of curriculum development accounts for a diversity of stories, numerous forms of literacy, and a variety of potential curricular paths. Postmodern curriculum development recognizes that the specific curricula and paths taken depend on the choices made by students—and what will best contribute to their learning and development, individually. Thus, this kind of curriculum development allows more freedom and autonomy for students in the process—and, it emphasizes the idea that there are numerous possible paths they could take. Finally, this vision for curriculum development is proleptic—in that it emphasizes “the interconnectedness of past, present, and future”, using curriculum as a tool to further students’ growth and personal narrative connectedness (p. 294).
