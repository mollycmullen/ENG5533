        <h1>Power Structures in Teaching & Learning</h1>
    
        <p> Unfortunately, often the prevalence of power structures in higher education classrooms contributes to inequalities in instruction within those classrooms—as teachers often fail to create learning environments that represent and serve the wide range of students within them. While “learning is optimized in an emotionally, mentally, and physically safe space where everyone belongs, has a voice, and is accepted as they are”, not all classrooms promote this kind of environment (Yosef & Vittoria, 2012, p. 17). This section connects to the Scholarship of Teaching & Learning (see: <a href="learnercentered.html">SoTL & Learner-Centered Pedagogy</a>), but it will focus specifically on power structures within higher education, how they lead to educational inequality, and how this inequality affects the learning experiences and holistic growth of students. </p>
        <p>   Within higher education, faculty members teach students from a variety of racial, social, ethnic, and ideological backgrounds. Faculty members, too, come from a range of backgrounds, with their own biases and assumed perceptions about what learning/literacy is and means. Thus, it is important for faculty members and higher education professionals to consider their own biases regarding literacy and literacy, as well as the different experiences, opportunities, and priorities of their students. Language and literacy relate to power and privilege—often, those who represent the dominate form of language and literacy (i.e., the single story--see: <a href="singlestories.html">Single Stories vs. Counter Stories</a>), withhold literacy development and education from those without the same level of power and privilege. Within a classroom setting, power primarily is held by teachers—they are the knowledge bearers, the gatekeepers of information. While power can (and, arguably, should) be shared with students in the classroom, the greater level of power is held by teachers. When power is imposed upon students in a damaging way—and when students’ thoughts, beliefs, and perspectives are stifled—this can affect both the academic and personal development of students, as “the emotional profoundly shapes pedagogical experience, including the experience of shame in pedagogical contexts” (Burke, 2017 p. 441). Being mindful of the power we hold as teachers and creating safe educational spaces for students to share their voices, thoughts, ideas, and beliefs is important towards the holistic development of their identities as human beings.</p>
              <p>     There are, of course, a variety of types (or bases) of power. French and Raven outline and describe a theory of social power—considering different forms of power prevalent within leader/follower (or teacher/learner) relationships, and the efficacies of these various bases of power (French & Raven, 2016). The primary bases of power they deliniate are reward power (which influences through rewards), coercive power (which influences through punishments), expert power (which influences through one’s demonstrated status as expert), legitimate power (which influences through one’s holding of a position of authority), and referent power (which influences by causing followers to want to be like or relate to the leader in some way) (2016). Referent power is the form of power that French and Raven’s research shows is most successful in the broadest range of situations—however, teachers often rely on the moderately successful expert power and reward power, or even the rarely successful coercive power in the classroom (2016). Even when these forms of power are successful, the result is often in teaching students simply to follow rules and/or meet requirements in order to succeed—rather than facilitating and encouraging authentic, holistic learning. Learning, at its core, is about identity development—as students not only learn about subject matter, but as they apply that subject matter to their lives and change as people through the learning process. Thus, teachers/professors are important guides as students discover, learn, and grow—but, if their goal is to encourage this kind of transformational education, their role cannot be as dictators of how to learn and what to learn. Certainly, all of these forms of power can be used and applied within the classroom efficaciously—but a teacher’s status as an expert, and their power to award grades, should be lesser to their role as guide, facilitator, and model to their students. Teachers are most effective in the classroom in terms of student learning, scholars argue, when they use referent power combined with expert power; i.e., when teachers use their expertise to influence students and facilitate their learning/growth primarily through causing students to <i>want</i> to grow and learn (Turman & Schrodt, 2006, p. 269). This is the way to lifelong learning, and the way to a transformative, self-motivated education.</p>
                Concepts of power in the classroom can also be applied in less theoretical ways. In her article, “Dismantling anti-black linguistic racism in English Language arts classrooms”, author Baker-Bell discusses the damaging effects of linguistic racism—and how to combat it, through what she calls “anti-racist black language pedagogy” (Baker-Bell, 2019, p. 8). This article specifically looks at racist pedagogies—how teachers who allow only one type of language or literacy expression in the classroom are contributing to educational inequalities and discrimination. However, the author also relates these concepts of literacy, inequality, and race to pedagogy and the classroom—and, these concepts can be applied broadly to all pedagogical decisions that result in the learning, language, or literacy styles of some students being discriminated against or marginalized. When teachers force students into a single story of learning that accounts for ONE learning style, ONE preferred form of English, and ONE preferred form of literacy, they project their own single story onto these students in a way that limits their personal and academic identity development (see: <a href="singlestories.html">Single Stories vs. Counter Stories</a>). Baker-Bell describes how “anti-black linguistic racism” and other forms of discrimination discourage the expression of non-majority dialects (such as AAE—African American English) and non-majority forms of literacy (e.g., visual media, web-based texts, music, games, graphic novels, etc.)—causing these forms of language and literacy to be at best stifled, and at worst eradicated entirely (2019, p. 8). When teachers project their own stories of literacy and learning onto their students, they do not promote holistic identity development—rather, they can cause a splintering or silencing of key aspects of their students’ identities.</p>
                <p> What constitutes literacy and learning? Should the above forms of literacy and language, often relegated to non-academic contexts, really be accepted as valid expressions of scholarly learning? Should teachers/professors really be willing to risk losing control of their classrooms by relying on non-authoritative, referent forms of power? Can linguistic racism and authoritative teaching methodologies be eradicated from higher education classrooms—and, if so, how? Baker-Bell’s article answer these questions with a resounding “yes”—as she presents one example of a pedagogical model that uses representative literature in the classroom; allows students to share control in the classroom; and considers the needs and perspectives of all students—rather than ignoring/isolating certain students’ perspectives and experiences—thus leading to more authentic, holistic learning in the classroom and curbing educational inequalities (2019).
