        <h1>SoTL & Learner-Centered Pedagogy</h1>
    
        <p> 		The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) involves university teachers “undertaking systematic inquiry about student learning” (Center for Engaged Learning, n. d.). SoTL research—and learner-centered pedagogy—show that in order to best meet the learning needs of their students, educators must teach in a way that caters to all styles of learning—rather than simply conveying knowledge in way that is efficacious for the teacher (Klipfel/Cook, 2017). This section will connect the concept of single/counter stories to both literacy and learner-centered pedagogy, discussing teaching and learning as a form of literacy, and biased unimodal instruction as a form of perpetuating a single story in the classroom (Adichie, 2009) (see: <a href="singlestories.html">Single Stories vs. Counter Stories</a>). There are a variety of learning styles, and people have different ideal ways of learning—indeed, Gardner showed that while some students learn best through lecture and verbal means, some learn best through collaboration; some learn best through action/doing; some learn best through visual means, etc. (1983)—though none of us fit neatly into any one category. While there are certainly “fundamental principles of human learning”, it is important for teachers to adjust their instruction to cater to individual learners (Eyler, 2018, p. 5). When educators teach in a way that stems only from their own learning styles/preferences, they are failing to meet the learning needs of their students. This kind of biased instruction is prevalent within higher education, though the causes of this problem are varied—sometimes, teachers simply lack formal teacher training. Other times, teachers intentionally choose the path of least resistance by teaching in a way that is familiar and helpful to them—but, not necessarily for their students. Learning is universal in that “all people can learn, want to learn, and learn continuously”—but learning is also personal and individualized in that “learning is specific to each learner in context” (Ben-Yosef & Vittorio, 2012, p. 7).

            <p>    This concept can be further explored through an analysis of the banking model versus constructivist theories of education. According to a banking model of education, the goal is for the teacher to fill “students with deposits of information considered by the teacher to be true knowledge, and the students store these deposits, intact, until needed” (Abdal-Haqq, 1998, para. 3). According to this model, then, it is entirely up to the teacher to determine what constitutes useful knowledge, as well as what modes of learning are to be used. A constructivist approach, however, maintains that “individuals create or construct their own new understandings or knowledge through the interaction of what they already know and believe and the ideas, events, and activities with which they come in contact” (para. 2). This approach means that students largely chart their own educational paths—and, it means that the unique learning styles, backgrounds, experiences, and ideas matter within the classroom. Thus, this model sees the teacher as a “guide, facilitator, and co-explorer who encourages learners to question, challenge, and formulate their own ideas, opinions, and conclusions”—rather than as an arbiter of knowledge (para. 2). The constructivist model, then, acknowledges that all students have their own stories—and that it is harmful when teachers impose their own single stories on their students. Teaching using a constructivist framework is challenging and certainly may not be intuitive—as the idea that students can “shape what they learn” means that instructors need to entirely rethink their philosophy, moving from “accurately relaying intriguing ideas” to creating and providing “learning contexts within which students (can) create their own ideas, as individuals and as a social group” (Eyler, 2018, p. 52). Despite requiring extra work for teachers, this shift in thinking is important—as research into learner-centered pedagogy and constructivism (as well as other educational theories) demonstrates the importance of “empowering students to take control of their own learning”—rather than their learning being dictated by another (p. 52).
