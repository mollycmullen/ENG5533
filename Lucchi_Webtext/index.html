        <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Ihs241zeg&feature=emb_title"><i>“Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity… …when we realize that there is never a single story about any place, we regain a kind of paradise.” (Ahichie, 2009)</i></blockquote> </p>
            
            <p> This webtext article will look at teaching and learning as a form of rhetoric—applying the notion of a “single story” (borrowed from Chimamanda Adhicie) to argue for why teachers should provide opportunity for individual autonomy in the classroom, cater to all learning styles, and allow for freedom in curriculum development, rather than impose their own “single stories” of teaching and learning on their students—thus contributing to inequalities in education, as some students receive the kind of instruction they need, but others do not. Furthermore, this article will explore the material and emotional consequences of this kind of teacher-centered and biased instruction occurring in the classroom. Through exploring SoTL (the scholarship of teaching and learning) and connecting it to stories (single vs. counter), this article will discuss how teaching according to “single story” methodologies of pedagogy and curriculum development can be seen as a form of linguistic inequality in the classroom; while teaching in a varied, learner-centered way allows for students to learn more effectively, and grow more fully and holistically. Narrative theory will also be used to connect the concept of single stories to identity development, and to help illustrate the consequences that these single stories can create not only pedagogically, but also developmentally. </p>
