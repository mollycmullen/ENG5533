        <h1>Conclusion: Transformative Education</h1>
    
        <p> 	In “Learning to Read”, an excerpt from his autobiography, Malcolm X recounts his experience learning to read, and the ultimate value of that education. He describes his learning experience in prison (a learning experience that provided him with resources but was otherwise self-directed) as entirely transformative: “I knew right there in prison that reading had changed forever the course of my life. As I see it today, the ability to read awoke inside me some long dormant craving to be mentally alive” (Malcolm X, 1965, p. 265). Additionally, this excerpt demonstrates Malcolm X’s ability to fit his learning into the narrative of his life—to use it to further his goals, but also to change who he was as a person—to grow into his identity. While Malcolm X’s learning experience was unique and certainly not desirable in its specific context, one theme of his education holds true for all teachers and learners: that education, when implemented in a way that allows for the personal autonomy to learn as desired and to fit that learning into one’s personal narrative, can be transformative.

            <p>   Louis Cozolino states that “stories connect us to one another, help to shape our identities, and serve to keep our brains integrated and regulated”—that stories are so “ubiquitous in human experience that we hardly notice their existence” (2013, p. 187). Despite the importance of stories—and despite damaging effects cause by imposing our own narratives of teaching and learning on students— we often do not realize what we are doing, or that we even maintain single stories at all. All educators must understand the consequences of teaching in a way that does not represent the needs of their students—whether this be due to teaching in a way that caters to a limited number of learning styles, or teaching in a way that implicitly excludes certain categories/groups of students from educational experiences. As educators, it is important for us to “see an value our students as fellow travelers on this educational journey” and “care enough to help them reach <i>their</i> destination” (emphasis added)—not <i>our</i> destination (Eyler, 2018, p. 147). Linguistic inequalities are prevalent within our classrooms unless we actively seek to dismantle them—thus, through recognizing our own biases, and adjusting our instruction so that instead of perpetuating single stories in the classroom, we can provide opportunity for transformative education in the classroom—for positive identity development. 
                <p>Education is all about learning, and learning is all about identity development. As authors Klipfel and Cook say, “The way to establish an emotional bond with learners is for them to experience us as the kind of person who understand and accepts them for their authentic selves (2017, p. 114). This means that teachers must not allow their own perceptions of literacy and learning, their own narratives, to be projected upon their students. If the goal of education is identity development, this means that students must be taught to learn in a way that develops their identity—rather than imposes an identity upon them. Through education, students have the opportunity to become more fully themselves, through a process that continues throughout their lifetimes. Forcing students into a box—whether that be through utilization of a single story learning style or curriculum, or through imposition of authoritative power structures—promotes inequalities in teaching/learning and dismantles potential for participatory learning community in the classroom. 
                </p>
                    <p>However, this is not the only story. Teachers have the choice to partner with their students—to allow for a diversity of stories to exist simultaneously within the classroom, and for the tension between these disparate stories to point towards something greater than our limited single stories. Because we do, in fact, have something to gain through listening to each other’s stories—teachers and learners alike. No teacher and no learner know all the secrets of the universe—there is truth that none of us will ever fully grasp, and there are biases we will always cling to of our own accord. However, through an anti-single-story model, we can allow the narratives of our lives and those of our students to be bigger and more beautiful than they ever could be on their own—we are all, after all, connected. We all have our own stories, but we are also all connected to the stories of others—because we are all a part of a bigger story. Our narrative identity development—i.e., our education—will only be truly transformative when we allow ourselves to each play a role in teaching and learning, and when we, as teachers, understand that our students’ individual stories matter. Education can be transformative; so let us live into that story.
